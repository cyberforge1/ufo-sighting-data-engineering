About Dataset
Context
This dataset contains over 80,000 reports of UFO sightings over the last century.

Content
There are two versions of this dataset: scrubbed and complete. The complete data includes entries where the location of the sighting was not found or blank (0.8146%) or have an erroneous or blank time (8.0237%). Since the reports date back to the 20th century, some older data might be obscured. Data contains city, state, time, description, and duration of each sighting.

Inspiration
